===============

Changes:
  - Track witch and tank damage regardless of whether or not we're including it in our mvp stat.
 
TODO:
  - Tank stats (collect and output stats when tank is up so we can see who isn't pulling their weight):
    - Common/SI killed during tank
    - Number of rocks eaten
    - Number of times pinned/smoked etc.
    - Total damage dealt to tank (if someone doesn't deal a lot of damage, doesn't clear SI/common and DOESNT get pinned, they're doing something wrong)
  - Misc stats
    - Number of times pinned/smoked etc.
    - Number of pills eaten
    - Total damage received
    - Kills of each zombie class
    - Track skeets
    - Boomer pops (without anyone getting boomed)
